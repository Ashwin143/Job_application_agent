## Summary
A customer-focused Cloud & AI Solution Engineer with over 7 years of experience architecting and deploying scalable, cloud-native AI applications. Proven expertise in guiding enterprise teams through the adoption of advanced AI/ML models, modern application architectures, and robust MLOps/GenAI Ops practices on platforms like Azure and AWS. Adept at leading hands-on technical engagements, from Proof of Concepts to production-scale deployments, to solve complex business challenges and drive innovation.

## Experience
**Senior Analyst/MLE | Tiger Analytics | Apr 2024 - May 2025

- Architected and deployed a scalable, cloud-native application using FastAPI on Azure Red Hat OpenShift, establishing a full CI/CD pipeline to enable automated, production-grade deployments for enterprise clients.
- Engineered and deployed a comprehensive ML Observability platform, providing end-to-end monitoring for data quality, model performance, and data drift to ensure Responsible AI practices.
- Led the migration of ML models from Azure VMs to Databricks, optimizing system performance and scalability while enabling real-time insights through bidirectional data workflows.
- Designed backend architecture integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models, demonstrating expertise in modern, agentic AI frameworks.


**Machine Learning Engineer | Neoware.ai| Apr 2023 - Dec 2023

- Designed and deployed containerized ML solutions using AWS Sagemaker, ECR, and ECS, showcasing expertise in full-stack cloud application architecture and microservices.
- Leveraged Azure AI services to build and deploy solutions for automated document text extraction, directly addressing customer data processing challenges.
- Engineered backend services for a data validation platform, ensuring data integrity and reliability for AI workflows.
- Patient Survival Prediction using XGBoost [Deployment with AWS ECR and ECS] 
- Sentiment Classification on Amazon Food Reviews dataset with EC2 deployment:We trained an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model to effectively categorise customer sentiments. The aim was to translate complex emotional nuances within text into actionable data. After successfully training the model, we went a step further by modularising the sentiment classification application. This modular approach not only made the system more maintainable but also scalable, potentially serving as a powerful tool for businesses to dynamically adapt to customer feedback. Skills and Tools:Natural Language Processing (NLP), Pandas, NumPy, Machine Learning. 

**Software Engineer | Wipro Technology Solutions| Jan 2022 - Apr 2023

- Developed and integrated backend services and APIs using the Django framework, building a strong foundation in full-stack application development. 
- Data visualisation with React and MUI 
- Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests: Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests: This project involved using classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson's Disease (PD) using patient voice recording data. Various models were used, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc., and the accuracy of these models was compared to determine the model for prediction Skills and Tools: EDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.

**Associate | Cognizant Technology Solutions| Aug 2017 - Dec 2021

- Developed and maintained Python-based automation scripts and contributed to framework development using Pytest.
- Enhanced test automation capabilities, working with build tools like CMake for underlying C++ components.
- Develop and maintain automation scripts based on test cases identified for automation. 
- Execute test cases within the functional, mobile, or web service automation framework.
